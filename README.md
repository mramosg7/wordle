# Wordle Game Information

## What is Wordle?

Wordle is a popular word puzzle game where you have to guess a 5-letter word in a maximum of 6 attempts. Each attempt gives you clues that help you figure out the correct word. 

The goal is to use the feedback from each guess to eventually guess the correct word.

## Indicators in the Game

In Wordle, there are three main indicators that tell you if a letter in your guess is correct or not. These indicators are color-coded to help you understand how close you are to the solution.

### 1. Correct Letter (Green)
- **Description**: The letter is in the word and in the correct position.
- **Example**: If you guess the word "V" and the letter is green, it means that "V" is in the correct position in the word.

### 2. Present Letter (Yellow)
- **Description**: The letter is in the word, but in a different position.
- **Example**: If you guess the word "A" and the letter is yellow, it means that "A" exists in the word, but not in the position where you guessed it.

### 3. Absent Letter (Gray)
- **Description**: The letter is not in the word at all.
- **Example**: If you guess the word "B" and the letter is gray, it means that "B" does not exist in the word.
